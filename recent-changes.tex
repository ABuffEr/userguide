\rcSect[8.4.1]{Version 8.4.1 (June 2017)}

This is a minor release that fixes one rarely encountered but serious bug with
the handling of CDATA sections within the text content of GATE XML format
documents.  CDATA has always been handled correctly in annotation and document
feature values, this bug would only affect a small number of documents where
the text contains many less-than signs (\verb!<<<!) \emph{and} few annotations.
In particular, \emph{annotated} documents that have been processed using the
GATE tokeniser are extremely unlikely to be affected as each less-than sign is
treated as a separate \texttt{Token} annotation.

This release also includes one small improvement to the Twitter hashtag
tokeniser so it recognises the names of some political parties when they occur
within hashtags such as \verb!#VoteLabour!.

\rcSect[8.4]{Version 8.4 (February 2017)}

GATE Developer and Embedded 8.4 is mainly a bug fix release, with a small
number of critical fixes compared to version 8.3.  This will be the final
major release of GATE before major re-structuring of the codebase and the plugin
system for version 8.5.

\begin{itemize}
\item Fixed an issue which had prevented the use of Java 8 lambda expressions
  in the RHS of JAPE rules, even when running on Java 8.
\item Removed OpenCalais and Zemanta plugins as the web services they depend on
  have changed and the plugins no longer work.
\item Fixed a bug that could cause the searchable datastore GUI to freeze.
\item Fixes to the TermRaider and Hindi sample applications
\end{itemize}

\rcSubsect{Java compatibility}

For GATE 8.4 we recommend the use of the latest Java 8 from Oracle.  If you are
still restricted to Java 7, most components will still work with the exception
of the Stanford CoreNLP tools and the TwitIE application (which uses the
Stanford POS tagger).  Future versions of GATE will require Java 8 as a
minimum.
